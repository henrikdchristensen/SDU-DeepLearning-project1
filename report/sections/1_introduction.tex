\section{Introduction}
The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of distinguishing between images of cats and dogs.
The task involves training a neural network using a dataset containing 3,600 images, equally divided between the two categories. The code and the notebook including all the results is available in the Appendix.

% The report is structured as follows: Section 2 explores the dataset and the possible features that can be extracted from it.
% Section 3 presents the architecture of the base model.
% Section 4 describes which the regularization techniques used, including data augmentation.
% Section 5 describes the final model for predicting cats and dogs and presents the results.
% Section 6 presents the results of a pretrained model 'AlexNet'.
% Finally, Section 7 concludes the report.
% In the Appendix, the code and a notebook with the results and visualizations are provided.
