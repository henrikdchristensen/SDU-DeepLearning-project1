\section{Introduction}
The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of distinguishing between images of cats and dogs.
The task involves training a neural network using a dataset containing 3,600 images, equally divided between the two categories.

% The report is structured as follows: Section 2 explores the dataset and the possible features that can be extracted from it.
% Section 3 describes which data augmentation techniques were used for the model training.
% Section 4 presents the architecture of the neural network.
% Section 5 describes the training process used to optimize the model.
% Section 6 presents the results obtained by the model.
% Section 7 presents the results of using a pre-trained model. Section 8 discusses the results and the limitations of the model.
% Finally, Section 9 concludes the report.
% In the Appendix, the code and a notebook with the results and visualizations are provided.
