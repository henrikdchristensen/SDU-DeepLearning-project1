\section{Model}
notes:
- Convolutional network with 4 convolutional layers. More conv layers, deep layers, neurons leads to overfitting?
- why the convolutional layers?
- We considered using a residual NN (put in results instead?)
- why the loss function?
- why the optimizer?
- why the number of epochs? purely time constrain?
- why the learning rate?
