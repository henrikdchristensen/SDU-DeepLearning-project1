\subsection{Improvements}
- Residual NN - more FC layers
- data augmentations
- restrictions of model

The model could have been improved in various ways. First of all more training data could potentially improve the model a lot, but we can't control this aspect.
Of the aspects we could control, we could have run epochs until the model began overfitting and then stopped at that point. If time was not a factor this is probably what we would have done. We could have also experimented more with the different parameters like learning rate and weight decay. 

We could have tried even more data augmentations to see what works best.
