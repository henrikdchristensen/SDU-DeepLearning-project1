\section{Pretrained Model}
To see if we could improve the model, a pretrained AlexNet model is implemented.
This model is pretrained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains 1.2 million images and 1000 classes, also including cats and dogs.
However, to use the pretrained model, the output layer is modified to fit the binary classification task of cats and dogs.

The results of the pretrained model after 25 epochs are shown in Figure \ref{fig:pretrained_model_results}.
